# dynamixel-source

A clean set of sources for cross-platform.

## Building sources

There are three environments where the dynamixel motors are being used:

* debian (linux64)
* windoze (win64)
* ubuntu-odroid (linux32)

The windoze is rather easy using Visual Studio and works well. Linux is a bit more complicated but more processural than anything else.
